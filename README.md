# GDPR Violation Plot

This is a simple visualization of the data of the General Data Protection Regulation (a regulation in EU law on 
data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA)), from the official repo 
of Tidy Tuesdays Project, englobing 2018, 2019 and 2020 and worldwide countries. 

I filtered the fins < 1000, I arranged the countries by alphabet order and visualized it in a log scale.
